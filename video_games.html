                        Games are a very special environment if we speak about typefaces. Whenever fonts are mentioned we usually think about web typography or print design.  Video games are not so often part of this discussion, despite the fact that the virtual space of video games is offering new interesting challenges for type designers.

                    <!-- <p>
                        The other question that interests me greatly is, why there is no obvious communication, discussion or intersection between type designers and game designers and developers? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same feeling?
                    </p> -->
                    <p>
                        Let me ask you how often you were frustrated trying to find a right font for your game?
                        It seems like itâ€™s still a problem to choose, to use legally or to append a font to a video game. 
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                       Sometimes you need a friend or teammate to reach the goal. I'm gonna go ahead and say that hopefully this person is a type designer.
